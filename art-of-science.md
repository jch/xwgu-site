Scanning electron microscope images of nanoscale objects often capture what
appear to be alien landscapes or extraterrestrial creatures. These images that
I’ve taken show nanostructures that look oddly familiar but may be
behaving extraordinarily.

## Nano-mushroom Circus Act

Precariously balanced platinum nano-mushrooms with 100 nm wide stalks. Winner of
the Caltech Art of Science competition 2013.

## Copper-Nickel Nanotree

Metallic nanostructure formed from a copper-nickel alloy. Branches of the “tree” are about 3 microns in width.

## Sideshow Bob in the Nanoworld

Copper nano-lattice with wild fractal-like hair. Base of the structure is 25 microns in width. Colorized scanning electron microscope image. Finalist in the Materials Research Society Spring Meeting art contest.
