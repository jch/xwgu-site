Acting Assistant Professor (starting June 2017)
Mechanical Engineering
Stanford University 

Previous positions:
Postdoc with [Paul Alivisatos](http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/pagrp/) at UC Berkeley, 2015-present
MS/PhD studies in Chemical Engineering, with a minor in Materials Science, at Caltech with [Julia Greer](http://www.jrgreer.caltech.edu/home.php), 2010-2014


I am a postdoctoral scholar in the [Alivisatos group](http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/pagrp/) in the Chemistry Department at UC Berkeley, where I am studying the 

I will be starting as an assistant professor in the Mechanical Engineering department at Stanford University beginning in June 2017. Check out my [future research plans]. (link to research group page)

I am a graduate student in the [Greer research group](http://www.jrgreer.caltech.edu/home.php) at the California Institute
of Technology. I expect to receive my PhD in Chemical Engineering, with a minor in Materials Science, by the end of 2014.

I fabricate and mechanically test nanostructures in order to study the
fundamentals of fracture and deformation in materials with nanoscale resolution.
I have studied fracture in crystalline and amorphous metals (metallic glasses)
with sizes confined to approximately 100 nm, in which mechanical failure is
determined by the interaction of structural flaws with free surfaces and
internal, microstructural features. Another focus of my research has been
architected nanostructures with mechanical properties that are enhanced relative
to their bulk counterparts due to structural topology and the sample-size
dependent strengthening present in certain classes of materials. I am currently
working on integrating architected Si nanostructures into Li-ion batteries as
high capacity electrodes.
