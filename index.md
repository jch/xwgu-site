# About

I am a graduate student in the Greer research group at the California Institute
of Technology. I expect to receive my PhD in Chemical Engineering, with a minor
in Materials Science, by the end of 2014.

I fabricate and mechanically test nanostructures in order to study the
fundamentals of fracture and deformation in materials with nanoscale resolution.
I have studied fracture in crystalline and amorphous metals (metallic glasses)
with sizes confined to approximately 100 nm, in which mechanical failure is
determined by the interaction of structural flaws with free surfaces and
internal, microstructural features. Another focus of my research has been
architected nanostructures with mechanical properties that are enhanced relative
to their bulk counterparts due to structural topology and the sample-size
dependent strengthening present in certain classes of materials. I am currently
working on integrating architected Si nanostructures into Li-ion batteries as
high capacity electrodes.
