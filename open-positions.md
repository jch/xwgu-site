# Open Positions

We are currently looking for highly motivated students and postdocs to join our team. The Gu group welcomes researchers with backgrounds in Mechanical Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, and Physics and related fields.

Students who have already been accepted to Stanford University can email Wendy <a href="mailto:xwgu@stanford.edu">xwgu@stanford.edu</a> to set up an in-person or Skype meeting to discuss research interests.
